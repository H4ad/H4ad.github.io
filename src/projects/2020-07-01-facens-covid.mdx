Facens Covid was a site developed during the pandemic to help Facens University control access to the campus.

In the application, you can answer some check-up questions to see if you are qualified to enter the campus, also, you can attend which
rooms you are entering by reading the QR Code, with this data we can analyze and identify how many people are infected and, if necessary, alert everyone
who stayed in the same room as the infected person.

Also, after the development of this app, I wrote a blog post about some css tips that I used in the app to reduce the amount of CSS and get the same visual result,
you can find it [here (pt-BR).](/posts/2020/07/26-os-poderes-do-css/)

In this project I was responsible for developing the mobile app in `Angular 2` and `Ionic 4`, and then we deploy this website as PWA to let user use as a mobile app.
All the code was written in `TypeScript`, using `SCSS` as the style language organizing in the methodology [BEM](https://getbem.com/introduction/).

I also helped to develop the API to serve and maintain the data for this application, the API was developed in `NestJS` and `TypeScript`.
After development, we use `AWS Lambda` and `API Gateway V2` to host the API and `AWS RDS` as the database service.
