UQR was a project to develop a learning platform to host some courses for real estate professionals to increase sales and rentals.

In this project, I worked on developing some features for the website in `Angular` and also did some maintenance on the developed backend
in `NestJS` and `Typescript`.

One interesting thing about this project was to develop a microsite builder to assemble the pages shown in the `images` section,
inside the panel, you can choose how you want to assemble the page, upload the image and texts and refresh to see the data being
reflected on the actual website.

Also in this project I had my first contact with server-side rendering, we needed better `SEO` support, so I added support for `Angular Universal`
and deployed within `AWS Lambda`.
