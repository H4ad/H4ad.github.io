Schaeffler is a mobile application intended to be used by the Schaeffler company to train its employees through some gamifications.

In this project, I work designing and developing the API for the mobile app using `NestJS` and `Typescript`.
I also develop a dashboard using `Angular` to aggregate and show all the information about the application usage and to manage the application.
