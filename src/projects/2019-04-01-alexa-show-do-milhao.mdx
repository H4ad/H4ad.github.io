In this project, a `Skill` was developed for Alexa with the theme of Show do Milhão,
where the user can have an experience with the program that marked its time.

In this project I was responsible for developing Alexa's `Skill` in `TypeScript`.
At the time, this was one of the first `Skill` created for Alexa, in addition, it allowed the user to
answer questions just by speaking the options using a similar word comparison algorithm.

In addition to `Skill`, I was responsible for developing the `API` in `ASP.NET Core`, in which it was hosted
inside an `EC2` on `AWS`.
