This was a project I started as a side project at my company to help them track how much time each user spends on the time tracking app within Monday.com.

After presenting it to my managers, it was very helpful for us to bring this side project as a real project within your company and to know that this project is responsible for
provide some valuable information about the current price of each project created on Monday.com by multiplying the hourly rate by the hours spent on that project.

In this project I use `NestJS` and `TypeScript` to develop the API and deploy it to `AWS Lambda` behind an `AWS API Gateway HTTP`, using `AWS RDS` as a database service.
For the dashboard, I develop using `Angular`, and inside the dashboard we can manage and see all result data from Monday.com.

After some time, the API started crashing due to the amount of data they are processing and we had to manually trigger the data update.
Then we added an `AWS EventBridge Scheduler` to trigger `AWS Lambda` directly using [Serverless Adapter](http://serverless-adapter.viniciusl.com.br/), developed by me,
which can manage both `AWS API Gateway HTTP` and `AWS EventBridge Scheduler` in the same codebase and the same lambda instance.
