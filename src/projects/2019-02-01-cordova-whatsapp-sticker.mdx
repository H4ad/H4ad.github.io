This is a plugin in Cordova, which allows you to share Stickers to your WhatsApp from
from an application created with `Ionic`. It was created from the need to share the stickers directly from `Ionic`.

At the time, I didn't find any documentation or code about it, just native code (`Java` or `iOS`),
so I decided to create a plugin by myself to make just that bridge between native code and `TypeScript`.
