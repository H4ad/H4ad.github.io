Votação Ratinho was a project we needed to build a voting system for a TV show called [Ratinho](https://www.sbt.com.br/auditorio/ratinho).

This voting system was used in a singer challenge, each one will sign and the program's audience will vote as many times as they want for their favorite
singer. In the following image, the score in the upper right corner showing each singer's vote percentages.

    objectFit: 'contain',
  }}

To build this project I use `NestJS` and `TypeScript`, for better performance I change from `Express` to `Fastify` and use `AWS Cloudfront` and `ElastiCache` as cache.
In order to handle the amount of votes I create a queue with `AWS SQS` and expose it using `API Gateway HTTP`, this way I could receive an infinite amount of votes because
all the infrastructure is the responsibility of `AWS`, and I only interact with this vote when I consume the queue in batches of 300 votes every 3s.

This project for me was so amazing that I wrote an article about the optimizations and architecture called
["From a million invocations to thousand with correct caching"](/posts/2022/12/08-from-million-invocations-to-thousand-with-correct-caching/).
