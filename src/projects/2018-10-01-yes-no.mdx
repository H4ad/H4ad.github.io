YesNo is an mobile app for you to send questions in conversation groups, or directly to a person,
to collect opinions. With it, you can see statistics about what people have chosen, comments and more.

In this project I was responsible for developing the application in `Angular 2` and `Ionic 3`, using `Cordova` to build the application for the store.
All the code was written in `TypeScript`, using `SCSS` as the style language organizing in the methodology [BEM](https://getbem.com/introduction/).
