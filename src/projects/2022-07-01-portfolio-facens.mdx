Portfolio Facens is a project to show the solutions developed by Liga and other sectors that are within the Facens company.

In this project, I developed the frontend using `React` and used libraries like `Zustand` and `React Query` to handle state and requests.
The site was hosted within `AWS` using `AWS S3` and `AWS Cloudfront`.

For the backend, I used `NestJS` and `TypeScript` and it was hosted inside `AWS Lambda` using `AWS RDS` as database service.

In this project I also use services like `AWS S3` to host the files, I added `OAuth2` authentication and I integrate with `Cloudflare Stream` to serve all the video files.

The `Cloudflare Stream` integration was very interesting because I structured the API using some design patterns that made it easy to integrate with `Cloudflare Stream` without much effort.
The workflow for this integration is: whenever a video file link is sent, I emit an event.
I have a listener that checks if it is hosted inside our `S3 Bucket`, if so I send a request to `Cloudflare Stream` to process the video inside that `S3 Bucket`, then `Cloudflare` sends it back to me a notification when processing is complete.
