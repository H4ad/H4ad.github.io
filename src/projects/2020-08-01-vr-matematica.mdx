VR Matemática was a project to a school to teach users more about matemathics throught the virtual reality.

In this project I developed the API to serve and maintain the data for this VR App, the API was developed in `NestJS` and `TypeScript`.
After development, we use `AWS Lambda` and `API Gateway HTTP` to host the API and `AWS RDS` as the database service.

In addition, I developed a dashboard to manage the API, this project had a concept of licenses that can be sold by the app owner to other schools
who want to integrate this VR app in their school curriculum. This dashboard was developed in `Angular` and hosted using `AWS Cloudfront` and `AWS S3`.
