Mamonas Assassinas was a Brazilian satirical rock band. Their musical style employed a humorous mixture between rock and a wide range of styles, often borrowing elements from other music, among which were the main riff of the Portuguese Vira ("Vira-Vira").
Inspired by your story, we created this app with a game and some albums to collect stickers by playing the game, after completing some parts of the album, you can unlock a pack of WhatsApp stickers.

In this project I was responsible for developing the mobile app in `Angular 2` and `Ionic 4`, using `Capacitor` to build the application.
All the code was written in `TypeScript`, using `SCSS` as the style language organizing in the methodology [BEM](https://getbem.com/introduction/).
